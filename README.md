# Terminal Duck

A runtime-aware rubber duck for VS Code. `@duck` is a chat participant that sees the commands you actually ran in the integrated terminal — with their exit codes and output — and grounds its answers in that history instead of making you copy-paste.

## How it works

Terminal Duck subscribes to VS Code's terminal shell integration events and keeps a rolling buffer of your last 20 commands (command line, working directory, exit code, captured output). When you ask `@duck` something in Copilot Chat, it includes the most recent executions as context for the LLM.

## Requirements

- VS Code `^1.95.0`
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) installed and signed in — Terminal Duck uses the `vscode.lm` API, which routes through Copilot's entitlement
- An integrated terminal with [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) active (default for bash, zsh, fish, and pwsh in recent VS Code)

## Install

Install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DarrenJaworski.terminal-duck):

- **From VS Code**: open the Extensions view, search for `Terminal Duck`, and click **Install**.
- **From the command line**: `code --install-extension DarrenJaworski.terminal-duck`

Or grab the `.vsix` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/darrenjaworski/terminal-duck/releases) and use Extensions view → **... (More Actions)** → **Install from VSIX...**.

## Usage

1. Run some commands in the integrated terminal.
2. Open Copilot Chat and type `@duck why did my last test fail?` (or any follow-up question).
3. Duck cites the specific command and exit code when relevant.

Example prompts:

- `@duck what's going wrong with my build?`
- `@duck the last command hung — what should I try?`
- `@duck I ran three things, give me a summary`

## Slash commands

| Command          | What it does                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@duck /fix`     | Finds the most recent failing command and proposes a single concrete fix.                     |
| `@duck /rerun`   | Suggests the next command to run — retry with different flags, or the natural follow-up step. |
| `@duck /explain` | Explains what the most recent command did and what its output means.                          |

## Failure nudge

When a terminal command exits non-zero, Terminal Duck pops a subtle **"Ask Duck?"** entry into the right side of the status bar for ~60 seconds. Click it and Copilot Chat opens pre-filled with `@duck /explain` and a question about the failure — no copy-paste, no remembering the participant exists.

If you'd rather not see it, set `terminalDuck.suggestOnFailure` to `false` (see [Settings](#settings)).

## Use from other agents (Language Model Tool)

Terminal Duck also registers a `#duck` tool via the `lm.tools` API. Any chat participant or Copilot agent-mode session can call it to fetch your recent terminal activity.

In Copilot Chat, reference it explicitly with `#duck` to include recent commands in the prompt:

```
#duck why might the test runner be picking up the wrong config?
```

Agents can invoke `terminal-duck_getRecentCommands` programmatically; accepts an optional `limit` (1–20, default 6).

## Commands

| Command                                       | Description                         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Terminal Duck: Clear captured shell history` | Wipes the in-memory command buffer. |

## Settings

| Setting                         | Default | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `terminalDuck.suggestOnFailure` | `true`  | Show the "Ask Duck?" status bar item after a non-zero exit in the integrated terminal. Auto-hides after 60 seconds. |

## Troubleshooting

**`@duck` says "no commands captured" right after I ran something.** Terminal Duck only sees commands that fire VS Code's shell-integration events. Quick checks:

- Open the integrated terminal and look for the small command decorations in the gutter (a chevron next to each prompt). If they're missing, shell integration isn't active for this terminal.
- Make sure your shell is one VS Code recognises (bash, zsh, fish, pwsh) and that you're using a recent VS Code release. See [VS Code's shell integration docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) for manual setup if your shell isn't auto-detected.
- Reopen the terminal after enabling integration — already-running terminals don't retroactively gain it.

**`@duck` replies that no language model is available.** Terminal Duck routes through Copilot's `vscode.lm` API. Confirm GitHub Copilot Chat is installed, signed in, and your account has Copilot access.

**Output looks truncated.** Each captured command is bounded at ~8 KB so the LLM context stays tight. The last 20 commands are kept.

## Caveats

- Shell integration must be active. If your terminal is a plain PTY (or you're running inside a shell VS Code doesn't recognise), Duck has nothing to work with and will say so.
- Output is truncated at ~8 KB per command to keep the LLM context tight.
- History lives in memory only — it resets when the extension reloads.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run kitchen-sink   # format:check, lint, typecheck, test, compile, package
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host with Terminal Duck loaded.
